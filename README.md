- Expert-level performance under the close-loop evaluation.

## üìù Abstract

The autoregressive world model exhibits robust generalization capabilities in vectorized scene understanding but encounters difficulties in deriving actions due to insufficient uncertainty modeling and self-delusion. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of deriving decisions from an autoregressive world model by addressing these challenges through the formulation of multiple probabilistic hypotheses. We propose LatentDriver, a framework models the environment‚Äôs next states and the ego vehicle‚Äôs possible actions as a mixture distribution, from which a deterministic control signal is then derived. By incorporating mixture modeling, the stochastic nature of decision- making is captured. Additionally, the self-delusion problem is mitigated by providing intermediate actions sampled from a distribution to the world model. Experimental results on the recently released close-loop benchmark Waymax demonstrate that LatentDriver surpasses state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods, achieving expert-level performance.

## ü§î Trouble Shooting

Most of the problems may be caused by the JAX environment. Here are some common problems and solutions.

Q1: The process is accidentally killed when running `preprocess_data.sh`. \
A1: You can reduce your batch size in `preprocess_data.sh` to avoid memory overflow.

Q2: "Jax [WARNING] No GPU/TPU found" when running `preprocess_data.sh`. \
A2: It is normal, when preprocessing data, we do not need GPU. You can use `python tools/quick_check.py` to check if your simulation environment is correctly set up.

Q3: During simulation, is it normal that the memory usage is high but power usage is low? \
A3: Yes, it is normal. And this need to be optimized in JAX.

## TODOs

- [ ] Training code & data for EasyChauffeur-PPO.
- [ ] Collecting and loading specific scenario for simulation.
- [x] Training code for LatentDriver and PlanT.
- [x] Weights for LatentDriver, PlanT and EasyChauffeur-PPO.
- [x] Data collecting code.
- [x] Code for identifying WOMD scene's types.
