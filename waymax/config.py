    data_format: The format of data in `path`, string from

    repeat: Number of times to repeat the dataset. Set None to repeat
      infinitely.
    batch_dims: Batch dimensions in tuple format. Can be empty as ().
    shuffle_seed: Random seed. Set None to disable shuffle.
    shuffle_buffer_size: Buffer size for shuffling.
    num_shards: Number of shards for parallel loading, no effect on data
      returned.
    deterministic: Whether to use deterministic parallel processing.
    include_sdc_paths: Whether to include all valid future paths for SDC
      according to roadgraph connectivity from its starting position.
    aggregate_timesteps: Whether to aggregate keys from tf examples, need to set
      to True for parsing SimulatorState afterwards.
    max_num_rg_points: Max number of roadgraph points in data.
    max_num_objects: Max number of total objects in the scene. Set None to
      include all objects from the data.
    num_paths: Number of roadgraph traversal paths. Must be specified if
      include_sdc_paths is True.
    num_points_per_path: Number of points per roadgraph traversal path. Must be
      specified if include_sdc_paths is True.
    drop_remainder: Argument for tf.data.Dataset.batch. Set True to drop
      remainder if the last batch does not contain enough examples. Note
      training should not be affected since it is looping over all data for
      multiple epochs. For evaluation, it should be set to False to include all
      examples.
    tf_data_service_address: A string or a tuple indicating how to connect to
      the tf.data service. Used as the `service` argument for
      tf.data.experimental.service.distribute in dataloader.
    distributed: If True, the generated data batch will have an extra leading
      axis corresponding to the number of available devices. This is needed when
      the returned data is consumed by a pmap function.
    batch_by_scenario: If True, one example in a returned batch is the entire
      scenario containing all objects; if False, the dataset will treat
      individual object trajectories as a training example rather than an entire
      scenario.
