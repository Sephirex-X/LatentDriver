"""Library for wrapping Waymax environments in a Brax-like interface.

For more information on the Brax interface see: https://github.com/google/brax.

The Waymax/Brax interface primarily differs from the Google/Brax interface in
the reset function. Because Waymax uses data to instantiate a new episode,
the reset function requires a SimulatorState argument, whereas the Google/Brax
interface requires only a random key.
