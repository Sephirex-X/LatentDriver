  """Data structure for a set of paths represented by roadgraph points.

  A `path` consists of a set of roadgraph points (usually along the lane center)
  and represents where an object can legally traverse giving its starting point.

  Attributes:
    x: Path coordinate x, shape is (..., num_paths, num_points_per_path) and
      dtype is float32.
    y: Path coordinate y, shape is (..., num_paths, num_points_per_path) and
      dtype is float32.
    z: Path coordinate z, shape is (..., num_paths, num_points_per_path) and
      dtype is float32.
    ids: IDs representing which lane the points belong to, shape is (...,
      num_paths, num_points_per_path) and dtype is int32.
    valid: Validity flag, shape is (..., num_paths, num_points_per_path) and
      dtype is bool.
    arc_length: Represents the arc length for each point from the starting point
      along the path with shape (..., num_paths, num_points_per_path) and dtype
      is float32.
    on_route: Flag for each path representing whether it is on the road route
      corresponding to the logged trajectory, shape is (..., num_paths, 1) and
      the dtype is bool.
